**Do you need your VMs to be on for this lab?**  
YES (windows-vm, linux-vm)

**Disable Windows Firewall and Install SQL Server and Create Vulnerabilities**
- Remote Into the VM (windows-vm)
- Turn off Windows Firewall (wf.msc)
	- Windows Defender Firewall Properties
	- Domain, Private, Public Profile, turn off 
	- Test connection with 'ping' command
- Install [SQL Server Evaluation 2019](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server-2019) (Extra endpoint to attack for learning purposes)
	- Download Media to create ISO > Mount > Installation > Install SQL Server Stand-alone
	- Feature Selection: **Check Database Engine Services**
	- Database Engine Configuration: **Mixed Mode**
	- Username: **sa (default)**
	- Password: **Cyberlab123!**
- Install [SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) 
- Enable logging for SQL Server to be ported into Windows Event Viewer ([Ref](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/auditing/write-sql-server-audit-events-to-the-security-log?view=sql-server-ver16))
	- Provide full permission for the SQL Server service account to the registry hive:  
	  `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\Security`.
	- Right Click Security > Permissions > Add > "NETWORK SERVICE" > Check Full Control
	- Run Command Prompt as administrator and execute:  
	  `auditpol /set /subcategory:"application generated" /success:enable /failure:enable`
- Test SQL logging to make sure it’s working properly
	- Open Microsoft SQL Server Manager Studio
		- Authentication: SQL Server Authentication
		- Check Trust server certificate
	- window-vm > Properties > Security > Login auditing > Check Both failed and successful logins
	- Disconnect from SQL Server and reconnect with bad credentials
		- Check for failed login in Event Viewer > Applications

**Test ping and logging into linux-vm via SSH**
- Ping linux-vm
	- In terminal: `ping <IP ADDRESS>`
- Login to linux-vm
	- In terminal: `ssh labuser@<IP ADDRESS>`

We will use both VMs in the next video, but you can turn them off for now if you want to save money
