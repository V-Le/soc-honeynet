### Capturing Analytics in Honeypot
**Make sure all of the following queries/tables return something:**
- SecurityEvent
- Syslog
- SecurityAlert
- SecurityIncident
- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL

**Let window-vm and linux-vm run for 24 hours.**
- Afterwards, we will count all the alerts/etc that happened in the last 24 hours and log them into the Spreadsheet
- Come back and count the alerts/etc, then make a comparison between the two for our portfolio
