**Do you need your VMs to be on for this lab?**  
NO  

Inspect MDC Secure Score ([Microsoft Secure Score](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-secure-score?view=o365-worldwide))

Inspect MDC Recommendations

ENABLE MDC Regulatory Compliance (this takesÂ  a while to appear)Â 

- NIST 800-53 ([NIST 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home)) (Slides Refresher: [NIST 800-53 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JeK0tJWWjHDwJ0_UZVHw5IqM0BLkbPC89yHSwFdY9jE/edit)) Compare NIST site with MDC recommendations
- In the next video we will Implement SC-7 (this could potentially take forever to implement in real life due to CAB (change a[https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home)dvisory board) and change management meetings/testing, but we can just do it.Â 


I think I mention this in the video, but some good ideas for additional portfolio projects might be walkthroughs on how to remediate some of the other findings from MDC Recommendations or the NIST 800-53 Regulatory Compliance Policy ðŸ™‚.

For Example: How-Toâ€™s for enabling MFA in Azure, implementing Azure Firewall, etc.

You can leave your VMs off.
