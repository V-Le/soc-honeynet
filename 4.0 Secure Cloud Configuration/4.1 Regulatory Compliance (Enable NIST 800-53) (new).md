Inspect MDC Recommendations

ENABLE MDC Regulatory Compliance (this takes¬† a while to appear)¬†

- NIST 800-53 ([Ref](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home)) (Slides Refresher: [NIST 800-53 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JeK0tJWWjHDwJ0_UZVHw5IqM0BLkbPC89yHSwFdY9jE/edit)) Compare NIST site with MDC recommendations

I think I mention this in the video, but some good ideas for additional portfolio projects might be walkthroughs on how to remediate some of the other findings from MDC Recommendations or the NIST 800-53 Regulatory Compliance Policy üôÇ.

For Example: How-To‚Äôs for enabling MFA in Azure, implementing Azure Firewall, etc.

  

You can leave your VMs off.
