**Do you need your VMs to be on for this lab?**  
YES (windows-vm)  


Inspect MDC Regulatory Compliance (Available and Implemented)
- NIST 800-53 ([Ref](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-53-controls/release-search#/families?version=5.1))
- We will Implement SC-7

Configure Azure Private Link and Firewall for your Azure Key Vault instance
- Ensure you use the same region and VNet the rest of your VMs are in

Configure Azure Private Link and Firewall for your Azure Storage Account instance
- Disable Public Access (you can only access from within your VMs now.)

- This is done on the network tab as well as the Settings -> configuration “Allow Blob public access → Disabled” as well

Observe Network Watcher Topology for the region and resource group all of your stuff is in.  

Observe the Key Vault and Storage Account Private Endpoints are there  

Wait 5 minutes (get coffee, etc)  

Login to “windows-vm” and check the IP addresses of your Key Vault and Storage Account instances.  

They should be private addresses, indicating the resources have been probably integrated into private VNet:

**If you see a public IP address, either it’s not done propagating yet, or it’s not configured correctly:**

(The above example was done from my personal Mac over the internet, but this is what it will look like when it’s not working–with the public IP addresses)  

Possible causes for this are your resources and VM are actually in different Virtual Networks, or something is just not setup right  

The good news is, you don’t need to fix this for the rest of the lab, we are just trying to lock down the environment. However, if you want to fix it, you can try deleting the Private Endpoints/config and trying again  

After this lab, we are going to let our environment run for 24 hours, so ensure both your windows-vm and linux-vm are on. The next day (24 hours later), we are going to capture our statistics for the locked down environment for our portfolio!
