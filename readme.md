## üõ°Ô∏è Introduction üõ°Ô∏è
In this project, I constructed a mini honeynet in Azure, integrating log sources from various resources into a Log Analytics workspace. This data was utilized by Microsoft Sentinel to build attack maps, trigger alerts, and create incidents. I measured security metrics in the initial, unsecured environment for 24 hours, then applied security controls to harden the environment, followed by another 24-hour measurement period. The results of these metrics, which are detailed below, demonstrate the impact of the applied security controls:

**The metrics we will show are:**
- SecurityEvent (Windows Event Logs)
- Syslog (Linux Event Logs)
- SecurityAlert (Log Analytics Alerts Triggered)
- SecurityIncident (Incidents created by Sentinel)
- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL (Malicious Flows allowed into our honeynet)

**The architecture of the mini honeynet in Azure consists of the following components:**
- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (2 windows, 1 linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account
- Microsoft Sentinel
