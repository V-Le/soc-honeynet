Do you need your VMs to be on for this lab?

NO (All VMs)

  
Check your Subscription’s [Cost Analysis](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_CostManagement/Menu/~/costanalysis/openedBy/AzurePortal)

  

Admin Mode (pretend you are normal admin):

Setup logging for Azure Active Directory (aka Microsoft Entra ID) and generate some logs

Create Diagnostic Settings to ingest Azure AD Logs

- Enable Audit Logs and Signin Logs for Azure AD
    

  

Check Log Analytics Workspace that the tables have been created: “AuditLogs” “SigninLogs”

  

Create a dummy user, username “dummy_user”

Log in with it once (incognito window)

  

Assign dummy_user the Role of Global Administrator

  

Delete dummy_user

  

Observe Audit Logs logs in Log Analytics Workspace

  

Rebuild/understand this query (Note: Some people’s tenant Global Administrator can show up as either Company Administrator or “Global Administrator”. Microsoft’s did this for some reason):

  

AuditLogs

| where OperationName == "Add member to role" and Result == "success"

| where TargetResources[0].modifiedProperties[1].newValue == '"Global Administrator"' or TargetResources[0].modifiedProperties[1].newValue == '"Company Administrator"' 

| order by TimeGenerated desc

| project TimeGenerated, OperationName, AssignedRole = TargetResources[0].modifiedProperties[1].newValue, Status = Result, TargetResources

  
  

Attacker Mode (pretend you are an attacker):

Simulate Brute Force Attack against Azure Active Directory (aka Microsoft Entra ID)

Create the “attacker” user if not exists already

- Produce 10-11 failed Logins with the portal
    

  

Admin Mode (pretend you are normal admin):

Observe SigninLogs in Log Analytics Workspace

  

Rebuild/understand this query:

SigninLogs

| where ResultDescription == "Invalid username or password or Invalid on-premise username or password."

| extend location = parse_json(LocationDetails)

| extend City = location.city, State = location.state, Country = location.countryOrRegion, Latitude = location.geoCoordinates.latitude, Longitude = location.geoCoordinates.longitude

| project TimeGenerated, ResultDescription, UserPrincipalName, AppDisplayName, IPAddress, IPAddressFromResourceProvider, City, State, Country, Latitude, Longitude

  

We don’t need VMs for the next video, so leave/turn them off if you want to save money
