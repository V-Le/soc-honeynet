Export Azure Activity Logs to Log Analytics Workspace

  

Generate some logs:

  

Create a new Resource Group named “Scratch-Resource-Group”

  

Create another new Resource Group named “Critical-Infrastructure-Wastewater”

  

Delete both “Scratch-Resource-Group” and “Critical-Infrastructure” (DO NOT ACCIDENTALLY DELETE YOUR LAB RESOURCE GROUP)

  

Test Lab Queries

  

// Querying for the deletion of critical Resource Groups

AzureActivity

| where ResourceGroup startswith "Critical-Infrastructure-"

| order by TimeGenerated

  

// Querying for changes to network security groups

AzureActivity

| where OperationNameValue == "MICROSOFT.NETWORK/NETWORKSECURITYGROUPS/SECURITYRULES/WRITE"

// Optionally, specific Resource Groups:

// | where ResourceGroup in ("resource-group-1", "resource-group-2") 

| order by TimeGenerated

  

// Deletion activities within a certain timespan

AzureActivity

| where OperationNameValue endswith "DELETE"

| where ActivityStatusValue == "Success"

| where TimeGenerated > ago(30m)

| order by TimeGenerated

  

// From Microsoft Defender for Cloud Security Events

AzureActivity

| where CategoryValue == "Security"

  

// Just stuff happening on the Management Plane

AzureActivity

| where CategoryValue != "Administrative"

  

We don’t need VMs for the next video, so leave/turn them off if you want to save money

  

Fin.
