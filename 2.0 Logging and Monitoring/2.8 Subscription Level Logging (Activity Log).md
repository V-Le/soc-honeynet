### Test Lab Queries
```
// Querying for the deletion of critical Resource Groups
AzureActivity
| where ResourceGroup startswith "Critical-Infrastructure-"
| order by TimeGenerated
```

```
// Querying for changes to network security groups
AzureActivity
| where OperationNameValue == "MICROSOFT.NETWORK/NETWORKSECURITYGROUPS/SECURITYRULES/WRITE"
// Optionally, specific Resource Groups:
// | where ResourceGroup in ("resource-group-1", "resource-group-2") 
| order by TimeGenerated
```

```
// Deletion activities within a certain timespan
AzureActivity
| where OperationNameValue endswith "DELETE"
| where ActivityStatusValue == "Success"
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30m)
| order by TimeGenerated
```

```
// From Microsoft Defender for Cloud Security Events
AzureActivity
| where CategoryValue == "Security"
```

```
// Just stuff happening on the Management Plane
AzureActivity
| where CategoryValue != "Administrative"
```
