<b><u>Resource Logs (aka Diagnostic Logs)</u></b> - Provides insight into operations that were performed within an Azure resource (the **Data Plane**). Examples might be getting a secret from a Key Vault or making a request to a database. The contents of **Resource Logs** varies by the Azure service and resource type.

<b><u>Configure Logging for Azure Storage</u></b>
Configure logging for your storage account by enabling diagnostic settings for blob storage.
- Collect All Logs and Metrics (metrics will record auth failures) and send to your **Log Analytics Workspace** instance
	- **Storage Accounts** -> Monitoring\[Diagnostic settings]  -> blob -> +Add diagnostic setting
	- ![|847](images/250124T13-23-03-tynfz8.jpg)

<b><u>Configure Logging for Key Vault</u></b>
Create a Key Vault Instance and configure logging by enabling diagnostic settings
- Collect the audit log and send to your **Log Analytics Workspace** instance
	- **Key Vault** -> +Create key vault
	- 
	- ![|508](images/250124T13-23-32-qxya3d.jpg)
- Add a secret to **Key Vault** called "Tenant-Global-Admin-Password" with a made up password
	- **Key Vault** -> Objects\[Secrets] -> +Generate/Import
	- ![|497](images/250124T13-23-55-6a99i2.jpg)
- Observe the key in **Key Vault**
- Enable monitoring for Key Vault
	- **Key Vault** -> Monitoring\[Diagnostic Settings] -> +Add diagnostic setting

Generate some Logs for Storage Account and Key Vault
- Generate some Logs for Azure Storage (read some blobs/files)
- Observe the Logs (they may take a moment to appear) -  KQL Query Cheat Sheet
