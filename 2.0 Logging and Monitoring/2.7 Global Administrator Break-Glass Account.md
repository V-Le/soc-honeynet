Do you need your VMs to be on for this lab?

NO (All VMs)


Create a backup account in Azure Active Directory (aka Microsoft Entra ID) and assign it Global Administrator 

Log into it once so you can change the password

Make note of the Accounts login (UPN) and password (consider a password manager)

  

We don’t need VMs for the next video, so leave/turn them off if you want to save money

  

Fin.
