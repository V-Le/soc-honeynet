Within Azure Sentinel, browse to “Analytics” -> “Active Rules”

- Manually create the “TEST: Brute Force ATTEMPT - Windows” Rule
    

- SecurityEvent  
    | where EventID == 4625  
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(60m)  
    | summarize FailureCount = count() by AttackerIP = IpAddress, EventID, Activity, DestinationHostName = Computer  
    | where FailureCount >= 10
    

- Try to trigger it
    
- Delete the Rule when finished
    

  

We’re going to continue to work with logs from the VMs, so it may be a good idea to leave your VM’s on (unless you’re going to go to bed or something and want to maximize your savings)

  

Fin.
