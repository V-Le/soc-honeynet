## Step 1: Preparation
- (We initiated this already by ingesting all of the logs into Log Analytics Workspace and Sentinel and configuring alert rules)
### Step 2: Detection & Analysis (You may have different alerts/incidents)
1. Set Severity, Status, Owner
2. View Full Details (New Experience)
3. Observe the Activity Log (for history of incident)
4. Observe Entities and Incident Timelines (are they doing anything else?)
5. “Investigate” the incident and continue trying to determine the scope
6. Inspect the entities and see if there are any related events
7. Determine legitimacy of the incident (True Positive, False Positive, etc.)
8. If True Positive, continue, if False positive, close it out

### Step 3: Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
Use the [Incident Response Playbook](3.11.1%20Incident%20Response%20Playbook.md).

**Initial Response Actions**
- Verify the authenticity of the alert or report.
- Identify the secret that was read and the user or application that read it.
- Determine how and when the secret was read.
- Assess the potential impact of the incident.

**Containment and Recovery**
- Revoke access to the secret from the affected user or application immediately if unintended, otherwise skip to the documentation phase.
- Check for any other unauthorized access to the secret and revoke it if necessary.
- Monitor the affected systems for any suspicious activity related to the incident.
- Identify the root cause of the incident and take corrective actions to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
- Change the secret if it was compromised.
### Step 4: Create Detailed Report and Close out the Incident in Sentinel
