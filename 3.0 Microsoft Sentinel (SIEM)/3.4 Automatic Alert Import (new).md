## CUSTOM: Brute Force Success Windows
This KQL query is designed to detect successful brute-force attacks on Windows systems by identifying IP addresses that have multiple failed logins followed by a successful login within the last hou
- This query helps **identify successful brute-force attacks** where an attacker made multiple failed login attempts before eventually succeeding in logging in within an hour.
- If the same **IP address** failed at least **5 times** before successfully logging in, it may indicate a **compromised account due to password guessing or credential stuffing**.
  
```
// Brute Force Success Windows
let FailedLogons = SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625 and LogonType == 3
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| summarize FailureCount = count() by AttackerIP = IpAddress, EventID, Activity, LogonType, DestinationHostName = Computer
| where FailureCount >= 5;
let SuccessfulLogons = SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4624 and LogonType == 3
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| summarize SuccessfulCount = count() by AttackerIP = IpAddress, LogonType, DestinationHostName = Computer, AuthenticationSuccessTime = TimeGenerated;
SuccessfulLogons
| join kind = inner FailedLogons on DestinationHostName, AttackerIP, LogonType
| project AuthenticationSuccessTime, AttackerIP, DestinationHostName, FailureCount, SuccessfulCount
```
  
**Failed Logins Detection (`FailedLogons`)**
 - Filters `SecurityEvent` logs where:
	  - `EventID == 4625` (failed logon attempts).
	  - `LogonType == 3` (network logon, typically remote access).
	  - The event occurred within the last hour (`TimeGenerated > ago(1h)`).
 - Groups (summarizes) the failed attempts by IP address (`AttackerIP`), event ID, activity, logon type, and destination host.
 - Keeps only IPs with **5 or more failed login attempts** (`where FailureCount >= 5`).
**Successful Logins Detection (`SuccessfulLogons`)**
 - Filters `SecurityEvent` logs where:
	  - `EventID == 4624` (successful logon).
	  - `LogonType == 3` (network logon).
	  - The event occurred within the last hour.
 - Groups the successful logins by IP address, logon type, destination host, and records the time of successful authentication.
**Joining Failed and Successful Logins (`join kind = inner`)**
 - Joins `FailedLogons` and `SuccessfulLogons` on:
	  - **Attacker IP (`AttackerIP`)**
	  - **Destination Host (`DestinationHostName`)**
	  - **Logon Type (`LogonType`)**
 - This ensures that only attackers who had multiple failed attempts and later successfully logged in are included.
**Final Output (`project`)**
 - Displays the following details:
	  - `AuthenticationSuccessTime` → Time of successful login.
	  - `AttackerIP` → The IP address of the attacker.
	  - `DestinationHostName` → The compromised machine.
	  - `FailureCount` → Number of failed attempts before success.
	  - `SuccessfulCount` → Number of successful logins (typically 1).

**Joining Failed and Successful Logins (`BruteForceSuccesses`)**
- Joins the **failed logins (`FailedLogons`)** and **successful logins (`SuccessfulLogons`)** on:
    - **Attacker IP (`AttackerIP`)**
    - **Destination Host (`DestinationHostName`)**
- This ensures that only attackers who failed **at least 5 times** before successfully logging in are included.
**Final Output (`BruteForceSuccesses`)**
- Displays details of successful brute-force attacks, including:
    - **Attacker IP (`AttackerIP`)** – The source of the attack.
    - **Destination Host (`DestinationHostName`)** – The compromised machine.
    - **Failure Count (`FailureCount`)** – Number of failed attempts before success.
    - **Success Time (`SuccessTime`)** – Timestamp of successful login.

## CUSTOM: Brute Force SUCCESS - Azure Active Directory
This KQL query is designed to **detect successful brute-force attacks** against **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** by identifying users who had multiple failed login attempts before a successful sign-in within the last hour.
- **Brute-force login attacks** in **Azure AD**, where an attacker tries multiple passwords and eventually succeeds.
- **Potential compromised accounts** due to successful authentication after repeated failures.
- **Suspicious login activity**, such as logins from unexpected IPs or locations.  

```
// Failed AAD logon
let FailedLogons = SigninLogs
| where Status.failureReason == "Invalid username or password or Invalid on-premise username or password."
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| project TimeGenerated, Status = Status.failureReason, UserPrincipalName, UserId, UserDisplayName, AppDisplayName, AttackerIP = IPAddress, IPAddressFromResourceProvider, City = LocationDetails.city, State = LocationDetails.state, Country = LocationDetails.country, Latitude = LocationDetails.geoCoordinates.latitude, Longitude = LocationDetails.geoCoordinates.longitude

| summarize SuccessCount = count() by AuthenticationSuccessTime = TimeGenerated, AttackerIP, UserPrincipalName, UserId, UserDisplayName;
let BruteForceSuccesses = SuccessfulLogons
| join kind = inner FailedLogons on AttackerIP, UserPrincipalName;
BruteForceSuccesses
| project AttackerIP, TargetAccount = UserPrincipalName, UserId, FailureCount, SuccessCount, AuthenticationSuccessTime
```

**Detecting Failed Logins (`FailedLogons`)**
- Extracts logs from **SigninLogs** where:
    - **Status.failureReason** is `"Invalid username or password or Invalid on-premise username or password."`
        - Indicates failed login attempts due to incorrect credentials.
    - **TimeGenerated > ago(1h)** → Filters for failures within the last **hour**.
- Projects relevant details:
    - **UserPrincipalName, UserId, UserDisplayName** → Identifies the targeted user.
    - **AttackerIP** → The IP address of the login attempt.
    - **Location Details** → City, state, country, latitude, longitude (helps identify possible geographic anomalies).
- Summarizes the **FailureCount** by **AttackerIP and UserPrincipalName**.
**Detecting Successful Logins (`SuccessfulLogons`)**
- Extracts logs where:
    - **Status.errorCode == 0** → Indicates a successful login.
    - **TimeGenerated > ago(1h)** → Filters for successful logins within the last hour.
- Projects similar details as failed logins.
- Summarizes the **SuccessCount** by **AttackerIP and UserPrincipalName**.
**Correlating Failed and Successful Logins (`BruteForceSuccesses`)**
- Performs an **inner join** on `FailedLogons` and `SuccessfulLogons` using:
    - **AttackerIP** → Ensures the same source IP is involved.
    - **UserPrincipalName** → Ensures the same account is targeted.
- This ensures only users who had **multiple failed attempts** before a **successful login** are detected.
**Final Output (`BruteForceSuccesses`)**
- Projects key fields:
    - **AttackerIP** → The source IP of the brute-force attack.
    - **TargetAccount (UserPrincipalName)** → The compromised account.
    - **UserId** → The unique identifier of the user.
    - **FailureCount** → The number of failed attempts before success.
    - **SuccessCount** → The number of successful logins.
    - **AuthenticationSuccessTime** → Timestamp of the successful login.

## CUSTOM: Malware Detected
This KQL query is filtering Windows event logs to detect specific **Windows Defender events** related to malware detection and remediation.
- This query helps monitor **malware activity on a system** by identifying when Windows Defender detects and responds to threats.
- If there are multiple `1116` events without corresponding `1117` events, it might indicate that Windows Defender **detected a threat but couldn't take action**, possibly due to permission issues or an outdated signature database.  
  
```
Event
| where EventLog == "Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational"
| where EventID == "1116" or EventID == "1117"
```
  
**Filters events from the "Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational" log**
 - This log records security-related events from Windows Defender, including malware detection, remediation, and security updates.
**Filters for specific Event IDs:**
 - **Event ID 1116** → **Malware detected**
	  - Indicates that Windows Defender has detected a **threat** on the system.
 - **Event ID 1117** → **Malware action taken**
	  - Indicates that Windows Defender has **acted** on the detected malware, such as quarantining or removing it.

## CUSTOM: Possible Privilege Escalation (Global Administrator Role Assignment)
This KQL query is designed to **detect role assignments** in **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)** where a user is added to a highly privileged role, such as **Global Administrator** or **Company Administrator**, within the last hour.
- **Privileged Role Escalation** → Identifies when a user is added to **Global Administrator** or **Company Administrator** in Azure AD.
- **Potential Security Risks**:
    - **Malicious activity** (e.g., an attacker or insider escalating privileges).
    - **Misconfigurations** (e.g., unintended admin role assignments).
    - **Compliance monitoring** for security audits.  
  
```
AuditLogs
| where OperationName == "Add member to role" and Result == "success"
| where TargetResources[0].modifiedProperties[1].newValue == '"Global Administrator"' or TargetResources[0].modifiedProperties[1].newValue == '"Company Administrator"' and TargetResources[0].type == "User"
| where TimeGenerated > ago(60m)
| project
    TimeGenerated,
    OperationName,
    AssignedRole = TargetResources[0].modifiedProperties[1].newValue,
    Status = Result,
    TargetResources,
    InitiatorID = InitiatedBy["user"]["id"],
    TargetID = TargetResources[0]["id"]
```

___
## CUSTOM: Windows Host Firewall Tampering
This KQL query is designed to **detect Windows Firewall rule modifications** by filtering events where a new rule has been **added** to the Windows Firewall.  

```
Event
| where EventLog == "Microsoft-Windows-Windows Firewall With Advanced Security/Firewall"
| where EventID == 2003
```

**Filtering Windows Firewall Logs (`EventLog`)**
- Extracts logs from **Microsoft-Windows-Windows Firewall With Advanced Security/Firewall**.
- Focuses on **EventID == 2003**, which specifically indicates when a **new inbound or outbound rule** is created.
	- A **legitimate configuration change** by an admin.
	- **Malicious activity**, such as an attacker creating rules to allow unauthorized access or disable security protections.

___
## CUSTOM: Possible Privilege Escalation (Azure Key Vault Critical Credential Retrieval or Update)
This KQL query is designed to **monitor access and modifications to a critical password stored in Azure Key Vault**, specifically tracking when a sensitive secret (e.g., `"Tenant-Global-Admin-Password"`) is accessed or updated.
- **Unauthorized or unusual access to critical credentials** in Azure Key Vault.
- **Potential security incidents**, such as an attacker retrieving or modifying admin credentials.
- **Compliance monitoring**, ensuring that only authorized users interact with sensitive secrets.  

```
// Updating a specific existing password Success
let CRITICAL_PASSWORD_NAME = "Tenant-Global-Admin-Password";
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.KEYVAULT" 
| where OperationName == "SecretGet" or OperationName == "SecretSet"
| where id_s contains CRITICAL_PASSWORD_NAME
```

**Defining the Critical Password Name**
- `CRITICAL_PASSWORD_NAME = "Tenant-Global-Admin-Password"`
- This variable specifies the **exact secret name** that the query will monitor.
**Filtering Azure Key Vault Logs (`AzureDiagnostics`)**
- Extracts logs where the **Resource Provider** is `"MICROSOFT.KEYVAULT"`, ensuring that only **Azure Key Vault activity** is included.
**Detecting Secret Access or Modification**
- Filters by **OperationName**:
    - `"SecretGet"` → Indicates a **read operation**, meaning someone retrieved the secret.
    - `"SecretSet"` → Indicates an **update operation**, meaning the secret was modified or replaced.
- Filters logs where `id_s` (the **resource ID or secret name**) **contains** `"Tenant-Global-Admin-Password"`, ensuring that only actions related to this specific password are captured.

___
## CUSTOM: Possible Lateral Movement (Excessive Password Resets)
This KQL query is designed to **detect excessive account changes or password resets** in **Azure AD Audit Logs**, potentially indicating **suspicious administrative activity or an account takeover attempt**.
- **Potential account takeovers** where an attacker gains access to an admin account and resets multiple passwords.
- **Abnormal administrative activity**, such as an insider or compromised admin making excessive changes.
- **Automated scripts or misconfigurations** that are making unintended bulk changes.   

```
AuditLogs
| where OperationName startswith "Change" or OperationName startswith "Reset"
| order by TimeGenerated
| summarize count() by tostring(InitiatedBy)
| project Count = count_, InitiatorId = parse_json(InitiatedBy).user.id, InitiatorUpn = parse_json(InitiatedBy).user.userPrincipalName, InitiatorIpAddress = parse_json(InitiatedBy).user.ipAddress 
| where Count >= 10
```

**Filtering for Change and Reset Operations**
- Extracts logs from **AuditLogs** where `OperationName`:
    - **Starts with "Change"** → Captures events related to modifications of user settings, permissions, or configurations.
    - **Starts with "Reset"** → Captures password reset events.
- These operations typically include:
    - Password resets.
    - Role or permission changes.
    - Security setting modifications.
**Sorting by Event Time**
- Orders the logs by `TimeGenerated` to **process events chronologically**.
**Counting Events per Initiator**
- Uses `summarize count()` to count the **number of change/reset operations** performed by each **initiator**.
**Extracting Initiator Details**
- Uses `parse_json(InitiatedBy).user` to extract:
    - **InitiatorId** → The unique ID of the user making the changes.
    - **InitiatorUpn** → The User Principal Name (UPN) of the initiator (e.g., email address).
    - **InitiatorIpAddress** → The IP address of the user performing the changes.
**Detecting High Activity Initiators**
- Filters for **initiators who performed 10 or more change/reset actions (`Count >= 10`)** within the dataset.

Note:
In the next section, we will generate traffic from “attack-vm” to trigger some of these rules.
Many of them will be triggered on their own from live Internet traffic.

We’re going to continue to work with logs from the VMs, so it may be a good idea to leave your VM’s on (unless you’re going to go to bed or something and want to maximize your savings)
