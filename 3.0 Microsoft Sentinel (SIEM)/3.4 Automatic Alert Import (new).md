**Do you need your VMs to be on for this lab?**  
YES (windows-vm, linux-vm)

Select the “CUSTOM: Brute Force SUCCESS - Windows” Alerts and “Edit” it:

Copy the query and fully inspect/dissect it in Log Analytics Workspace

User [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) to understand the rule further:

(This even works on complicated queries such as “CUSTOM: Brute Force SUCCESS - Azure Active Directory”)

Do this for the remaining “CUSTOM” Analytics Rules. Make sure you understand.

Note:
In the next section, we will generate traffic from “attack-vm” to trigger some of these rules.
Many of them will be triggered on their own from live Internet traffic.

We’re going to continue to work with logs from the VMs, so it may be a good idea to leave your VM’s on (unless you’re going to go to bed or something and want to maximize your savings)
