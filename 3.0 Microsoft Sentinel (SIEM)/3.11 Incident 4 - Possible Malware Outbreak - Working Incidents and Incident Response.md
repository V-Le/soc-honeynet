Step 1: Preparation

- (We initiated this already by ingesting all of the logs into Log Analytics Workspace and Sentinel and configuring alert rules)
    

  

Step 2: Detection & Analysis (You may have different alerts/incidents)

1. Set Severity, Status, Owner
    
2. View Full Details (New Experience)
    
3. Observe the Activity Log (for history of incident)
    
4. Observe Entities and Incident Timelines (are they doing anything else?)
    
5. “Investigate” the incident and continue trying to determine the scope
    
6. Inspect the entities and see if there are any related events
    
7. Determine legitimacy of the incident (True Positive, False Positive, etc.)
    
8. If True Positive, continue, if False positive, close it out
    

  

Step 3: Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

- Use the simple [Incident Response PlayBook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EQ5MzN95POLaRIMulYg3PIH3UGHtDNcGdkFvgOXyEXQ/edit#)
    

  

Step 4: Document Findings/Info and Clouse out the Incident in Sentinel
