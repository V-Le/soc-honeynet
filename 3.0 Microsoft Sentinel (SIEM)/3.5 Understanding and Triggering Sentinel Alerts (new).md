**Do you need your VMs to be on for this lab?**  
YES (windows-vm, linux-vm)  

Start: 1:00

Observed Logs: 13:40

Trigger AAD Brute Force Success 
- (from within attack-vm) Simulate brute force success against Azure AD with your attacker account:
- In an incognito windows, open portal.azure.com and fail 10-11 logins in a row, followed by a successful login
- Bonus points if you want to try with PowerShell: [AAD-Brute-Force-Success-Simulator.ps1](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Cyber-Course-V2/edit/main/Attack-Scripts/AAD-Brute-Force-Success-Simulator.ps1)


Start: 7:46

Observed Logs: 15:40

Trigger MSSQL Brute Force Attempt 
- (from within attack-vm) Open SSMS and simulate brute force attempt against your SQL Server by attempting to log into it 10-11 times
- Possible to do with PowerShell, not required [SQL-Brute-Force-Simulator.ps1](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Cyber-Course-V2/blob/main/Attack-Scripts/SQL-Brute-Force-Simulator.ps1)

Start: 16:30

Observed Logs: 21:35

Trigger Malware Outbreak

(from within windows-vm) Generate a Malware alert by using an EICAR file
- [Malware-Generator-EICAR.ps1](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Cyber-Course/blob/main/Attack-Scripts/Malware-Generator-EICAR.ps1) (Do from within Windows VM)
- (this can be done manually by creating a text file with the EICAR string in it)

Start: 24:50

Observed Logs: 28:00

Trigger Possible Privilege Escalation (AKV Critical Credential Retrieval or Update) 
- Manually Read Key Vault Secret “Tenant-Global-Admin-Password” in the portal and observe the incidents

Start: 29:20

Observed Logs: 31:05

Trigger Windows Host Firewall Tampering
- Manually Enable and Disable the windows-vm Firewall and observe the incidents

Start: 34:10

Observed Logs: 42:55

Trigger Excessive Password Resets
- Manually Trigger excessive password resets ([KQL-Cheat-Sheet.md](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Cyber-Course-V2/blob/main/KQL-Query-Cheat-Sheet.md)) and observe the incidents by resetting a users’ password in the portal 10-11 times

Optional: attempt to trigger the rest of the custom rules to make sure they work

Note:
It does take a bit of time for the logs to show up in Log Analytics Workspace
If you want to trigger Brute Force attempts for Linux and RDP, simply fail logging into these several times, but I assume the internet is doing a good job of that already.

We’re going to continue to work with logs from the VMs, so it may be a good idea to leave your VM’s on (unless you’re going to go to bed or something and want to maximize your savings)

HOWEVER, you do not need the attack VM from this point, so feel free to turn it off or delete it
