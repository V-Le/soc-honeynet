**Do you need your VMs to be on for this lab?**  
YES (windows-vm, linux-vm, attack-vm)  
### Trigger AAD Brute Force Success
From within attack-vm, simulate brute force success against Azure AD with your attacker account:
- In an incognito windows, open portal.azure.com and fail 10-11 logins in a row, followed by a successful login
- Bonus points if you want to try with PowerShell: **[AAD-Brute-Force-Success-Simulator.ps1](images/AAD-Brute-Force-Success-Simulator.ps1)**
### Trigger MSSQL Brute Force Attempt
From within attack-vm, open SSMS and simulate brute force attempt against your SQL Server by attempting to log into it 10-11 times
- Possible to do with PowerShell, not required: **[SQL-Brute-Force-Simulator.ps1](images/SQL-Brute-Force-Simulator.ps1)**
### Trigger Malware Outbreak
From within window-vm, generate a Malware alert by using an EICAR file
- **[Malware-Generator-EICAR.ps1](images/Malware-Generator-EICAR.ps1)** (Do from within Windows VM)
  *Note: This can be done manually by creating a text file with the EICAR string in it*
### Trigger Possible Privilege Escalation (AKV Critical Credential Retrieval or Update)
Manually Read Key Vault Secret “Tenant-Global-Admin-Password” in the portal and observe the incidents
### Trigger Windows Host Firewall Tampering
Manually Enable and Disable the windows-vm Firewall (wf.msc) and observe the incidents
### Trigger Excessive Password Resets
Manually Trigger excessive password resets ([KQL-Cheat-Sheet.md](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Cyber-Course-V2/blob/main/KQL-Query-Cheat-Sheet.md)) and observe the incidents by resetting a users’ password in the portal 10-11 times

Note:
It does take a bit of time for the logs to show up in Log Analytics Workspace
If you want to trigger Brute Force attempts for Linux and RDP, simply fail logging into these several times, but I assume the internet is doing a good job of that already.

We’re going to continue to work with logs from the VMs, so it may be a good idea to leave your VM’s on (unless you’re going to go to bed or something and want to maximize your savings)

HOWEVER, you do not need the attack VM from this point, so feel free to turn it off or delete it
