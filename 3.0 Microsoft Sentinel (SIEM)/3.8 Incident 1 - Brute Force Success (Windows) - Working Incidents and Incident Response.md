### Step 1: Preparation
- (We initiated this already by ingesting all of the logs into Log Analytics Workspace and Sentinel and configuring alert rules)
### Step 2: Detection & Analysis (You may have different alerts/incidents)
1. Set Severity, Status, Owner
2. View Full Details (New Experience)
3. Observe the Activity Log (for history of incident)
4. Observe Entities and Incident Timelines (are they doing anything else?)
5. “Investigate” the incident and continue trying to determine the scope
6. Inspect the entities and see if there are any related events
7. Determine legitimacy of the incident (True Positive, False Positive, etc.)
8. If True Positive, continue, if False positive, close it out

### Step 3: Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
Use the [Incident Response Playbook](3.11.1%20Incident%20Response%20Playbook.md).
- Lock down the NSG assigned to that VM/Subnet, either entirely, or to allow only necessary traffic.
- Block attacking IP address
- Reset the affected user’s password
- Enable MFA 
### Step 4: Create Detailed Report and Close out the Incident in Sentinel
# **Cybersecurity Incident Report**
**Incident Number:** 45
**Date & Time of Incident:** 2/26/2025, 06:09 PM
**Reported By:** John Doe
**Affected System(s):**
- **Hostname:** window-vm
- **IP Address:** 192.168.1.100
- **Operating System:** Windows 10
## **1. Incident Summary**
At **2/26/2025, 06:09 PM**, a successful **brute-force attack** was detected on **window-vm**. The attacker, originating from **IP 20.5.199.153 (Sydney, Australia)**, gained unauthorized access using repeated login attempts over **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol, Logon Type 3)**. The attack was confirmed through log analysis and correlation of multiple failed and subsequent successful logins.

## **2. Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**
- **Source IP Address:** `20.5.199.153` (Geolocated to Sydney, Australia)
- **Time of First Failed Login Attempt:** 2/26/2025, 05:09 PM
- **Total Failed Logins:** `19`
- **Time of First Successful Login:** 2/26/2025, 06:09 PM
- **Targeted Username(s):** `labuser`
- **Authentication Method:** NTLM
- **Event IDs:**
    - **4625** (Failed Logon Attempts)
    - **4624** (Successful Logon)
## **3. Impact Assessment**
- Unauthorized access granted to the Windows Server
- Possible exfiltration of sensitive data (pending further investigation)
- Potential installation of malicious tools for persistence
- Increased risk of lateral movement across the network
## **4. Mitigation & Response Actions**
**Immediate Actions Taken:**
- **User Account Disabled:** `labuser` account disabled
- **Password Reset:** Enforced password reset for affected accounts
- **Session Terminated:** All active sessions from `20.5.199.153` forcibly logged out
- **Firewall Rule Applied:** Blocked `20.5.199.153` on perimeter and host-based firewalls

**Ongoing Investigation:**
- Reviewing Windows Event Logs for suspicious activity post-compromise
- Scanning for malware or unauthorized changes
- Analyzing network traffic logs for data exfiltration attempts
## **5. Recommendations & Preventive Measures**
- Enforce **account lockout policy** after `5` failed attempts
- Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for remote access
- Restrict **RDP access** to specific IPs or VPN users
- Implement **intrusion detection systems (IDS/IPS)** for brute-force attack detection
## **6. Conclusion**
The attack resulted in a successful login but was **detected and mitigated before further damage could occur**. Additional investigation is ongoing to determine the extent of compromise and ensure no persistent threats remain.
